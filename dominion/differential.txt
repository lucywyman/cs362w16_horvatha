I ran my version of dominion.c against Kyle Nichols' version of dominion.c and found only one interesting (to me) difference.
For some reason, my code coverage for my implementation of dominion.c is 75.7% while my testdominion.c with his implementation
only reached 66.6% of the code. Other than that, it was rather hard to compare using diff as there was a lot of output and
due to the random nature of my testdominion.c (random kingdom cards, random number of players, random cards played, etc.) having two similar
run-throughs of a game of dominion even with just my implementation of dominion.c would result in very different outputs, so comparing
between my version and Kyle's seemed to not result in many interesting findings. Both files can be found in my directory as
"testdominion.out" (or "gameResults.out") and "testdominion.out.kyle". The output from diff is also in my directory as "diff.gameResults.out".
