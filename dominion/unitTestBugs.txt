Writing unittest1.c was probably the most difficult unit test, as it required me to
gain a more complete understanding of the way that dominion.c was structured and how these functions were being called
(either between functions in dominion.c or in the actual playdom.c program). As there is a lack of documentation or comments explaining what the functions
do or what the parameters mean. After reading through the code and tracing through function calls, I was able to write a unit test that tested the base case of the function
correctly. unittest2.c was a bit easier, but required debugging when running into an error that there wasn't enough buys, requiring me to change the 
buyCount property of the gameState struct. This assignment required me to create a correct mental model of the way that the game
is run and the way that various aspects of the game are treated within the gameState struct.
