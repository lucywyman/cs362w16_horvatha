So I've been trying to make randomtestadventurer.c... Better. It's been a wild ride.
Since the code was originally written when we were using a different version of dominion.c, there was some cleaning
up that needed to be done just to make it run "correctly". From there, I seeded rand so it didn't result in the same output every time.
However, there's been a large struggle trying to get the code from breaking every single time it runs. Often times we are caught in an infinite loop
when trying to draw a card as there isn't a copper, gold, or silver in the user's hand. This suggests either an oversight in the implementation of
case adventurer in the cardEffect function or else modifications need to be made to the test suite. As it's day 1, I'm going to sleep on it.
