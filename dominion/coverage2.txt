After running gcov, I found that 34.9% of the code was covered through my 8 tests.
This means that the majority of the code was not covered, which suggests that either my test cases
need to be more robust and fully cover each function/card case, or there simply needs to be more unit tests.
Some lines of code weren't covered simply because there was error checking that my unit test didn't cover (such as
in buyCard, if the player doesn't have enough buys they cannot buy a card, resulting in the code going down an error
path). In the future, I would add more conditions to my unit tests to ensure that not only is all code covered, the
conditions checking the state of the game are working properly to prevent stupid errors resulting in buggy code.
