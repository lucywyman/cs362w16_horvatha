I found that with a classmates changes to playcard and buycard our implementations differed enough for there to be noticible change in the .out files and have diff pick it up. I also made small changes to other functions throughout this class so that could have had an effect but since play and buycard are the most commonly called in my testdominion and I saw changes in those, I will guess that is why.
