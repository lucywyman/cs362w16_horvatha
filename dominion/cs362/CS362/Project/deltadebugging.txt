I used zeller's delta debugging tool on the quick sort function that was causing a seg fault. Upon running it with my failing inputs the debugging tool was able to reduce the inputs it failed with which made me realize it was a size problem. I was feeding the quick sort too large of arrays to sort and unreasonably so (when in dominion do you have a deck of 500 cards) so I reduced the inputs to the function and was able to solve my problem. I don't feel this was an ideal case to use delta debugging as my inputs were relatively simple (mainly an array representing a deck) and there weren't many steps to the process that it could remove however it was a cool tool overall.
