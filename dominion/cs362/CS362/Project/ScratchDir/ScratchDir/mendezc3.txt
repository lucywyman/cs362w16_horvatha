There is an issue with your steward card, when trying to draw from a full deck and the discard isn't reset. 

Upon calling cardeffect with the following:

(steward, 1, 0, 0, state, handPos, 0)
With handpos = 323
And state containing the following

state->hand 498 : state->deck 0 : state->discard 476
 After drawing we would expect 
	Hand 499 : Deck 474 : Discard 1
	With the hand having drawn two and discarded 1, the deck being reshuffled
and drawn from and the adventurer card but instead the result state is set to

state->hand 495 : state->deck 0 : state->discard 476

With the hand having lost three cards, the discard and deck staying the same
