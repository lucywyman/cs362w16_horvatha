Found bug in your steward card, it never increases the coin count when the choice to select coin count is available.

Test Conditions
	Called card effect with the parameters (steward, 2, 0, 0, state, handPos, 0);
	Where state contained 13 coins in the coin field and handPos was 8. After
card effect the coins were at 13 still instead of at 15 where they should
be.
