Once upon a time, I wrote a random test for the adventurer and steward cards in dominion.

randomStewardTest.c
	In the random steward test, I generated a random state and then based on
that, called card effects either with the choice to draw two cards, trash two
cards or add two coins. Upon cardeffects return I used asserts to see if the
state reached the expected value (check that the coins have increased by two
for example). 

	I encountered the following errors: 
		Failed assert - state->deckCount and state->handCount will
occasionally fail asserts. In particular had state->handCount fail assert when
it went from 3 cards to 21 cards after requesting only two draws. Also had
another case where it went from 18 to -4. Same issues with state->deckCount
where it would go from 1 to -2. 

randomAdventurerTest.c
	In the random adventurer test, I generated a random state then called
cardEffect specifying adventurer as the card, then I checked that the coins
increased by true(added to the dominion.c file a statement that increments the
coins by 1 everytime a treasure is drawn) and checked that the cards were
correctly discarded that were not coins. 

	I encountered the following errors:
		Seg Fault(received a SIGABRT signal according to gdb) - when the adventurer tried to draw a card from a deck after
the deck was empty and re-shuffled. The call to drawCard causes the fault.
This seems to only happen about half the time I make and run this test.
